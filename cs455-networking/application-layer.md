# Application Layer

## Transport Service

* Data integrity
* Timing
* Throughput
* Jitter
  * Variance in latency

TCP
* reliable transport
* byte-stream oriented
* flow control
* congestion control
* connection-oriented
* does not provide
  * timing
  * minimum throughput guarantee
  * security

UDP
* unreliable data transfer
* datagram
* does not provide
  * reliability
  * flow control
  * congestion control
  * timing
  * throughput guarantee
  * security
  * connection setup

## DNS

```
x.y.z.w
```

* 32 bit unsigned sequence
