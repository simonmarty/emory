# Tries

Lookup time: O(size of alphabet * length of pattern)

Build
* Add strings one by one

### Compressive prefix tries
* When a node only has one child


Good for individual words

**Store all suffixes of the text**

(Textbook: append word with a new character "$")

Suffix trie: Search time is O(m)
