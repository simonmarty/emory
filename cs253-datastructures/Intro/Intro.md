# CS 253

Make sure to check out the [Emory Honor code](http://catalog.college.emory.edu/academic/policies-regulations/honor-code.html) and the [CS Department Policy on Assignments](https://www.cs.emory.edu/undergraduate/general-information/spca/).

* Data structures preprocess data for efficient retrieval later
  + Preprocessing time and memory
  + Query time
  + Update time
* Algorithms that exploit those data structures

## Grading

* Homework (50%)
* Midterm (20%)
* Final (30%)

## Homework

Homework assignments will be a mix of programming and written assignments, the latter  of  which  will typically bec onceptual in nature. Written assignments must be *typed* (with the exception of any drawings) and  submitted  via  Canvas  as  a **PDF document**.

Barring unforseen circumstances, late assignments are penalized by **10% each day**, up to 7 days, after which the assignment will not be accepted.

Excused absences require additional documentation (e.g.a doctor’s note) to avoid the penalty.

## Midterm and Final

In-class, closed book, on Dec 13th, 8:00AM

## Content of the course

* **Greedy algorithm**
    - Usually a heuristic, but sometimes optimal
* **Dynamic Programming**
    - Break into subproblems
    - Solve each subproblem once
    - Solve original problem, possibly using solutions to subproblems multiple times
* **Huffman code**
* **Knuth Morris Prath**
* **Shell sort**
* **Graph algorithms**
    - Dijkstra’s
    - Min spanning tree
    - network flow
* **Theory of stable allocations**
* **Linear Programming**

## Arrays

**Pros**:

* Easy to use, Easy access
* Constant Time, any index

**Cons**:

* Fixed size
* Fixed location

## Linked List

* Slow access
