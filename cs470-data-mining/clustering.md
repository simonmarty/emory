# Clustering

## Probabilistic Model-Based Clustering

* Cluster analysis is to find hidden categories
* A hidden category (i.e. *probabilistic cluster*) is a distribution over the data space, which can be
mathematicall represented using a probability density function (or
distribution function).
* A **mixture model** assumes that a set of observed objects is a mixture of instances from multiple
probabilitstic clusters, and conceptually each observed object is generated independently.
* **Out task**: Infer a set of *k* probabilistic clusters that is mostly likely to generate *D* using
the above data generation process

## Model-Based Clustering

* A set C of k probabilistic clusters with probability density functions 
f<sub>1</sub>,...,f<sub>k</sub> respectively, and their probabilities
&omega;<sub>1</sub>,...,&omega;<sub>k</sub>
* Probability of an object *o* generated by cluster C<sub>j</sub> is 
P(*o*|C<sub>j</sub>) = &omega;<sub>j</sub>f<sub>j</sub>

### Univariate Gaussian Mixture Model


## The EM Algorithm

* Two steps
    * Expectation Step
    * Maximization Step

## Subspace Clustering Methods
* Correlation base clustering methods
* Bi-clustering methods
