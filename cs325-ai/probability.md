# Probability

General situation
* Observed variables (evidence)
* Unobserved variables
* Model

Probabilistic reasoning gives us a framework for managing our beliefs and knowledge1

## Probabilistic Inference

Compute a desired probability from other known probabilities (e.g. conditional from joint)

We generally compute conditional probabilities
* They represents the agent's *beliefs* given the evidence

Probabilities change with new evidence
* P(on time | no accidents, 5a.m.) = 0.95
* P(on time | no accidents, 5a.m., raining) = 0.80
* Observing new evidence causes beliefs to be updated
