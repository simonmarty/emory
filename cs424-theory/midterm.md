## Problem Set 1

* A few regular properties combined &rarr; Regular Language
* Any finite language is regular
* If you can write a program for it, it's likely at least decidable
* PDA - > CFG
* If a unary language is regular, it has to become periodic at some point.
* Co-recognizable: Complement is turing recognizable


## TODO

* Show pumping on `{a, b}*` with equal number of a's and b's
